It is important to note that this indicator represents flood risk not in terms of maximum possible impact but rather as average annual impact. The impacts from infrequent, extreme flood years are averaged with more common, less newsworthy flood years to produce the “expected annual affected population.” Higher values indicate that a greater proportion of the population is expected to be impacted by Riverine floods on average.",

A second critical feature of sub-basin delineations is the way the sub-basins are grouped or coded to allow for the creation of nested sub-basins at different scales, or to navigate within the sub-basin network from up- to downstream. To support these functionalities and topological concepts, the ‘Pfafstetter’ coding system has been implemented, offering 12 hierarchically nested sub-basin breakdowns globally.",

Anthropogenic pressures such as land use conversion have caused dramatic changes to the composition of species communities and this layer illustrates these changes by focusing on the impact of forest change on biodiversity intactness. The maximum value indicates no human impact, while lower values indicate that intactness has been reduced. The Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity in Changing Terrestrial Systems (PREDICTS) database comprises over 3 million records of geographically and taxonomically representative data of land use impacts to local biodiversity (Hudson et al. 2017). A subset of the PREDICTS database, including data pertaining to forested biomes only, is employed to model the impacts of land use change and human population density on the intactness of local species communities. To produce the land use map, all forested biomes are selected and each 30 x 30 m pixel within the biome is assigned a land use category based upon inputs from the GFW forest change database and a downscaled land use map (Hoskins et al 2016). The modelled results of biodiversity intactness derived from the PREDICTS database are projected onto the land use and human population density maps, and the final product is aggregated to match the resolution of the downscaled land use map (Hoskins et al 2016). The final output models the impacts of forest change on local biodiversity intactness within forested biomes.",
