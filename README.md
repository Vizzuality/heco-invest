# HeCo Invest

HeCo Invest is a digital collaborative platform aimed to support filling the conservation financing gap in the Amazon Basin by optimizing project financing channels in this region.

It is the result of collaboration between the IDB Lab, the IDB Natural Capital Laboratory, WWF and the Colombian government through its Herencia Colombia program. It also includes the participation of the Paulson Institute, the Basque Institute for Climate Change (BC3) and several of the most relevant actors in the conservation and management of the natural capital of the Amazon worldwide.

## Project sustainability impacts

At the core of the platform is the computation of projects' sustainability impact. The methodology has been defined by BC3 as described [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yEQjtbDL3LzPjsi9W4cybJ7M5d33S70_). Four sustainability impact dimensions have been identified: **Biodiversity**, **Climate**,  **Community**, and **Water**. 
The **Biodiversity** dimension will contribute to identifying areas of greatest ecosystem diversity, degree of threat or protection for flora and fauna, including landscape connectivity, and degree of endemism. 
The **Climate** dimension will be used to identify areas where interventions can be implemented to help improve climate regulation of the land sector, deforestation degradation, and carbon sequestration in both soil and biomass. 
The **Community** dimension will contribute to identifying production systems and sustainable practices where local and indigenous communities can thrive while enhancing their adaptation to climate change. 
Finally, the **Water** impact dimension will play a key role in protecting the environmental factors that help maintain the availability and regulation of the water resources, including reducing risks such as floods and droughts.
